## 📂 **My Favorite Projects**

- **[🌐 PyTorch Neural Network](https://github.com/jdvanegasm/PyTorch-Neural-Network):**  
    A symmetric neural network designed to classify handwritten numbers, optimizing hyperparameters and minimizing classification loss.
    
- **[📈 Descriptive Analysis of Multidimensional Poverty](https://github.com/jdvanegasm/Descriptive-Analysis-of-Multidimensional-Poverty):**  
    Descriptive analysis of data from DANE on 208 poverty dimensions. Categorizing the population and calculating indices to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
    
- **[📉 Descriptive Analysis of Unidimensional Poverty](https://github.com/jdvanegasm/Descriptive-Analysis-of-Unidimensional-Poverty):**  
    Similar to the previous project but focused on unidimensional poverty dimensions, providing clear visualizations for better understanding.
    
- **[🖼️ PyTorch CIFAR-10 CNN](https://github.com/jdvanegasm/PyTorch-CIFAR-10-CNN):**  
    Convolutional neural network focused on animal image classification, optimized with hyperparameters to achieve high accuracy.
    
- **[🧭 Tourist Web Application](https://github.com/jdvanegasm/Tourist-Web-Application):**  
    A web app for tourists to search attractions by keywords, countries, or cities. Features include user registration, login, posts with galleries, descriptions, and comments. Built with Django and Vue.js.
    
- **[🎬 ML Algorithm for Movie Recommendations](https://github.com/jdvanegasm/ML-Algorithm-for-movie-recommendations):**  
    A machine learning algorithm that recommends movies using cosine similarity and data vectorization to optimize results.
